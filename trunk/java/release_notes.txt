  - Introducing equals() and hashCode() methods for the Phonenumber.PhoneNumber class

Jan 28th, 2011
* Code changes:
  - Fixing critical bug with non-Android-compatible code. isEmpty() was being used and CANON_EQ in
    reg-ex matches.

Jan 20th, 2011
* Code improvements:
  - Handle null phone-numbers when parsing by throwing a NumberParseException.
  - Handle extension written with an accented "o", as per Spanish, when parsing.
  - Handle U+30FC dashes as phone-number punctuation.
  - Allow "ZZ" or null regions to be specified for numbers starting with a full-width "+" symbol, or
    with other characters (such as whitespace) before the leading +.
  - new getLengthOfNationalDestinationCode function
* Metadata changes:
  - New types of numbers introduced: UAN (universal or "company" numbers) and short codes. Note that
    "generalDesc" patterns do not encompass short-codes.  No code-support for these has been
    introduced as of yet. We are also now enabling the collection of data for information such as
    area-code-optional, and no-international-dialling ranges.

    DE, DJ, EE, GB, GN, HU, IE, JO, JP, LB, LR, MA, MK, MN, MR, NA, PG, SC, SG, SO, SZ, VN, ZA, ZW
