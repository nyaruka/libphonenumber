= Introduction =

These steps outline how to edit the metadata for the phone number library to fix problems with validation or formatting.

= Details =

==Prerequisite steps==
First, read the documentation here on how to submit patches: [https://code.google.com/p/libphonenumber/wiki/ContributeToTheProject]

==Edit the data==
Next, edit the appropriate resource file(s):
  * resources/PhoneNumberMetadata.xml for normal validation/formatting issues
  * resources/ShortNumberMetadata.xml for short-code data
  * resources/PhoneNumberAlternateFormats.xml for alternate patterns for phone number matching
  * resources/geocoding/xx for geocoding data (where xx is the language code you wish to edit)
  * resources/carrier/xx for carrier mapping data

Note:
  * include sources for data where appropriate
  * if multiple countries share a country calling code, check all of them are updated. Formatting rules will only be listed by the country with "mainCountryForCode" set to `true`.
  * details on each field in the xml file can be found at the top of the file and in `resources/phonemetadata.proto`.

==Generate data files==
===Java===
{{{
ant -f java/build.xml junit
}}}

This will generate new binary files under `java/libphonenumber/src/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/data`, `geocoder/src/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/carrier/data` and `geocoder/src/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/geocoding/data`

===Javascript===
{{{
ant -f java/build.xml build-js-metadata
}}}

This will generate new js metadata files; you should also now compile the changes, as per the instructions in javascript/README.

===C++===
See the C++ README (cpp/README) instructions for how to build and run C++. You should build it with USE_LITE_METADATA set to ON as well as OFF, which will generate both a `metadata.cc` and a `metadata_lite.cc` file.

==Test changes==
===Java===
Build a jar:
{{{
ant -f java/build.xml jar
}}}

Then run your own demo: [https://code.google.com/p/libphonenumber/wiki/HowToRunJavaDemo] and test your changes are as expected.

===Javascript===
See javascript/README for how to run the demo page in your browser.
